# InterWeb 55 Web Browser for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard

This repository holds the source tree for InterWeb 55. It is a modern web browser based on the UXP/MÃ¶bius codebase maintained by Roytam1, which was originally a fork from Firefox 53.

InterWeb 55 is kept up to date with the modern web and vastly outpaces other 10.6-compatible web browsers in terms of web compatibility, features, and performance.
